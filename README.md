The United States Geological Survey (USGS) collect an impressive amount of scientific data about natural hazards each day. An example of the type of data they collect revolves around global earthquakes and includes such information as their magnitudes, depths, locations, and much more. Though they collect massive amounts of this data, they lack a meaningful way of visualizing this data in a digestible format. The aim of this project is to help the USGS better educate the public with data visualization via Javascript and Leaflet. 

A JSON containing all global earthquake information in the past 7 days was used to create an interactive map that displays markers at every earthquake’s location. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes boast a larger sized marker. Additionally, the marker’s color is darker depending on the depth of the recorded earthquake. When clicked, each marker provides relevant information to the user including location, magnitude and depth.
